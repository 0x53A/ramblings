    <h3><i>Claude and Me, sitting in a tree, <strike>kissing</strike> writing a filesystem</i></h3>

    <p>
        The last few days I've started writing a filesystem in Rust.
    </p>

    <p><b>Why?</b> Well, I couldn't find anything *exactly* like it, and I had time on my hand.</p>

    <p>
        <b>What</b> is it supposed to do?

        It should be an <b>encrypted</b>, <b>deduplicating</b>, <b>virtual</b> fs.
    </p>

    <p>
        * Being a 'virtual' Filesystem means that instead of formatting a naked block device with your FS, the data is
        instead projected into an existing filesystem.
        <br />
        * 'Encrypted' is mostly self explanatory.
        <br />
        * 'Deduplicating', well, if I save the same file multiple times, it should save the actual content only once and
        then only reference it the other times. That could also be solved by softlinks and/or hardlinks with a
        traditional FS. In addition, it would be great to also deduplicate *similar*

    </p>

    <p><b>How?</b> In Linux it's actually pretty easy to create a new filesystem; no need to create a new kernel driver
        or anything; just write a FUSE (Filesystem in U) client, which is a normal program that communicates with the
        existing FUSE kernel driver to do the actual work. <br />
        It's not the most efficient way to do it, sine each operation will need to do multiple roundtrips through
        kernelmode and usermode, but who cares, I don't.

    <h4>Preamble</h4>

    <p>My setup is the following:
        I have a cheap VPS at Hetzner (CAX11, 4.51€/Month). The VPS has only 40 GB of SSD storage, and adding another
        SSD volume directly is expensive, but I can mount a 1 TB <i>Storage Box</i> for 3,81€/Month.
        Great! A reasonably powerful VPS with a TB of storage for less than 10€ per Month!
        <br />
        It being a cloud storage, I didn't feel comfortable to just write my data directly onto the storage box. Instead
        I wanted to encrypt it at-rest.
        Now, to be fair, since the VPS is also hosted in the cloud, if someone really wanted to, they could trivially
        extract the encryption key from the memory of the running VPS. But I'm not looking to defend against state level
        attackers, I just don't want a bored Hetzner employee snooping around.
        <br />
        So, the setup is:
        I have the VPS. The storage box is mounted through CIFS into the VPS. The virtual fs is then mounted on top of
        the storage box.
    </p>


    <p>Before started two write my own filesystem I tried to use gocryptfs. After a few days I noticed corruption in my volume<a
            href="#todo"><sup>*</sup></a>. To be fair, I have a hunch thats related to the storage box, and not directly
        to gocryptfs, but still ...
        <br />
        Besides, it only checks the <b><i>encrypted</i></b> box, not
        the <b><i>deduplicated</i></b> checkbox.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4>Let's go</h4>


    <p>
        Naturally, I chose Rust to implement this (it's just the obvious choice for a filesystem), and found an existing
        FUSE crate in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fuser">fuser</a> (<a
            href="https://github.com/cberner/fuser">GH</a>) by <a href="https://github.com/cberner">Christopher
            Berner</a>.

        <br />
        The repository contains a few samples, one of which, the "SimpleFS" is actually almost what I want and need:
        it's a virtual filesystem, with a folder on another filesystem as backing storage, that stores metadata in one
        subfolder, with the inode as filename, and actual content in a second folder.
        That is, you have a flat hierarchy just two levels deep:

    <pre><code style="font-family: 'Berkeley Mono', monospace; font-size: 13px">
    storage/
    ├── inodes/
    │   ├── 1
    │   ├── 2
    │   └── 3
    │
    └── content/
        ├── 1
        ├── 2
        └── 3
</code></pre>

    This flat hierarchy also means you'll never run into any path size issues on the backend, regardless of how deep the
    folder structure inside your virtual filesystem becomes.

    <br />
    The only thing that happens is that the file that represents the metadata will slightly grow.


    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    -----------------------

    <br />
    That has also been one of my frustrations with all these encrypted filesystems. They *do* encrypt the filenames,
    but the folder structure is still mirrored.

    <pre><code style="font-family: 'Berkeley Mono', monospace; font-size: 13px">
storage/
├── inodes/
│   ├── 1
│   ├── 2
│   └── 3
│
├── content/
│   ├── 1
│   ├── 2
│   └── 3
</code></pre>

    my guess is that the corruption of my gocryptfs volume came because the path length of the underlying storage
    (storage box mounted through CIFS) was exceeded. While this would lift the primary blame from gocryptfs, it's still
    to blame because there's no reason to mirror the plain folderstructure into the encrypted folder.
